					<h3>COOKIE POLICY</h3>
					<p>This page explains how EPS (Easy Payment System) (referred to in this document as “EPS”, “we”, or “our”) uses cookies and similar technologies on our website and application. It lists cookies that are or may be set in your web browser when visiting the website, why we use these cookies, and your rights and options in controlling the use of the cookies.
					</p>

					<h4>WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h4>

					<p>Cookies are small snippets of text that are placed on your device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by websites around the world in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, or to report on the success of advertising initiatives, or to serve ads that users may actually be interested in.
                    </p>
					<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, EPS) are called “first party”. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are “third party cookies”. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website – for example, if you click a paid advertisement served by Google, a Google cookie may help us determine the effectiveness of said advertisement.
